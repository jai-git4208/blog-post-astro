### The Auditing Process

My cat spends approximately 14 hours a day "auditing" the air. If the air does not meet his standards (i.e., it doesn't smell like tuna), he will perform a dramatic sneeze and leave the room in a huff. He also does some black magic kind of thingy.

#### Corporate Restructuring
He has recently demanded that all human movement be cleared through his office(underr my bed) Failure to comply results in a "mandatory ankle meeting" at 3 AM.

**Executive Summary:** I live here. He manages the molecule count.
