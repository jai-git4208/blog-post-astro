You know bananas can time travel, my banana stays yellow but after i look away it get spots(thats when it time travelled and came back and now its corrupted).

### The "Blink" Hypothesis

My researchers (a cat and a very cute cupcake) have concluded that bananas use a primitive form of chronancy. They exists in a state of superposition, both ripe and overripe, until a human makes a conscious observation.

#### Conclusion
Eat them fast. Or wear goggles. We haven't figured out which one works better yet. SHUTUP CUPCAKE GO STUDY! ow.
